9.5.2017 - Found out we're apparently cancelling the group project we were working on so starting on the Linux assignment.
10.5.2017 - Still trying to figure this out but having some problems with the virtualbox system
Can't get the computers to detect each other, have set up multiple servers but nothing seems to be working. 
Decided to just try to set up the Apache web thing and mailing list stuff.
Can't seem to be able to get the domain to work with localhost, when typing stefan.local into the address bar just gets nothing but using https://localhost, seems to be working.
Just gonna try to get help with this, can't make a lot of progress in one night since I hadn't prepared at all for this since I thought we were gonna do the group project thing.
